Monazite is a rare phosphate mineral consisting of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, thorium, and phosphate or silicate (Ce, La, Nd, Th) (PO4, SiO4). It typically occurs in small isolated grains and is often found as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, pegmatite, schist, and gneiss. Over time, these grains resist weathering and accumulate in soils and sediments, making them concentrated and viable for extraction when found in significant amounts.

Statistics

The global monazite market was valued at US$ 285.4 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 486.2 million by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% from 2025 to 2032. The growing demand for rare earth elements and thorium across various industries contributes significantly to this growth.

In the United States, the monazite market size was US$ 62.8 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 98.5 million by 2032, with a growth rate of 5.8% CAGR during the same forecast period. This growth is driven primarily by technological advancements and the increasing demand for rare earth materials, particularly in sectors like electronics, medical devices, and clean energy.
