Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Emulsion is a type of vinyl chloride acrylic copolymer known for its superior chemical resistance, flexibility, and ease of processing. It is primarily produced through emulsion polymerization, where monomers are dispersed in water with the help of surfactants. PVC emulsions are widely used in coatings, adhesives, textiles, and synthetic leather due to their excellent film-forming properties and high mechanical strength.
